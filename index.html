              <p class="lead">

The SALIENT project focuses on the development of systems for training graph
neural networks (GNNs) that are fast, scalable, and accurate. The system,
called SALIENT, is designed to operate within existing
abstractions in popular libraries for training GNNs, such as PyTorch Geometric,
and do not require machine learning practitioners to rewrite their models or
adopt a new framework.




	      <!---Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
              directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
              a converter (like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>)
              and our <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> renderer, and
              spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable
              for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine
              behind <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which means you can use Jekyll
              to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers <strong>for
	      free</strong>.</p>--->

	    The SALIENT project has resulted in the development of two systems for training GNNs: SALIENT and SALIENT++. These systems are fast, scalable, and accurate, and operate within existing abstractions in popular libraries for training GNNs. Learn more about the systems and how to use them on <a href="#">this page</a>. The code for SALIENT and SALIENT++ is available on github <a href="#">Github</a>
